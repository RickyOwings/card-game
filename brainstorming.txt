So the idea is to make some sort of card game. I am kind of inspired by Stacklands a little bit. Definetely not that though...

We could have a card class react component. It would have a health, different properties, an image and such.
    - Image
    - Abilities

For now, we could have a bot mode where you attack a bot player... It would be good to build the game so that it has a back end or something...
    - If a back end is created, then we could check the attacks on the server side to make sure they are valid. You could also play against someone else...

Everything is turn based like pokemon. You have to submit your moves. Then it sends your move to the server.
